Main repo for plugins made by me

There's a lot that needs to go here.

The demo for Dungeon Generator is pretty complete and it should be fairly straight-forward, so dive in. It is based on this code: http://kidscancode.org/blog/2018/12/godot3_procgen8/ . It should be noted, however, that my version uses autotiling, so the tileset you use must have autotiling enabled. In particular, I used a Tilesetter-generated tileset; if you need to use a different one, there's code in here where you'll see `Vector2(3, 3)`: change that to something that makes sense for your set (in this case, it points to the icon I used to represent the tileset in the editor).
